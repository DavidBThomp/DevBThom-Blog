      <description>This is a project I had in the works for a period of over 4/5 months. My goal was to replicate the site, which I did, and then touch up that recreation to bring it modern features. I also wanted to give the home page a bit of a facelift, and fix other various minor errors. I am happy with how it came out! The experience taught me about hosting, BootStrap 5, and semantic HTML.</description>

      <description>The vision for this project was to re-create the site staying committed to the basic sitemap of the current site. To do this, we simplified the sitemap even more and decided to work on a single page site. The only external tools used is jQuery and Google Fonts.
The 3 key points for the new site:
Theming and Site Color Navigation and Footer Fixes Responsive Web Design Theme and Color The old site used a color pallet of light green, red, and white.</description>

      <description>One thing I found confusing about WordPress was how themes, plugins, and widgets can change so much over the management of a site. For one theme you have an editor, for another one you have customization, and so on. I think one thing that was made clear to me from the Udemy course I took regarding WordPress is to find your way to make one thing, then add on. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn how to use the new editor, themes, widgets, plugins, and all the other new features at once.</description>
