      <description>This is a project I had in the works for a period of over 4/5 months. My goal was to replicate the site, which I did, and then touch up that recreation to bring it modern features. I also wanted to give the home page a bit of a facelift, and fix other various minor errors. I am happy with how it came out! The experience taught me about hosting, BootStrap 5, and semantic HTML.</description>
