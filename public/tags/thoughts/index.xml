      <description>I think that a lot of the time, web development can be an end goal for someone, a means to a purpose. I am in that same boat but want to use it as a means to a degree of fulfillment. I view what I want to do as a path that has different options. A corporate job, passionate software developers, freelance nomads, etc. I see myself as someone pursuing that freelance nomad ideal with the addition of wanting to help as many people as I can.</description>
