      <description>One thing I found confusing about WordPress was how themes, plugins, and widgets can change so much over the management of a site. For one theme you have an editor, for another one you have customization, and so on. I think one thing that was made clear to me from the Udemy course I took regarding WordPress is to find your way to make one thing, then add on. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn how to use the new editor, themes, widgets, plugins, and all the other new features at once.</description>

      <description>When looking to add to your toolkit as a web developer, WordPress is a great place to start and add to your tool kit. I earned my Associate in Applied Science in Web Development and wanted to work ASAP. As I started looking at what I could do on my own I realized my skills and potential would be limited if I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn about the platform that hosts 33% of websites!</description>
