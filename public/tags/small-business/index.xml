      <description>What Workflow? One major shift in terms of the way I want to further pursue my ideal web development dreams has to do with my workflow. I think that while I was focusing on too many different things, I had nothing to a point of being extremely comfortable. I want to create, manage, and innovate a system for myself that allows me to best invest my time in web development. I hope you likewise find a system for yourself.</description>

      <description>I think that a lot of the time, web development can be an end goal for someone, a means to a purpose. I am in that same boat but want to use it as a means to a degree of fulfillment. I view what I want to do as a path that has different options. A corporate job, passionate software developers, freelance nomads, etc. I see myself as someone pursuing that freelance nomad ideal with the addition of wanting to help as many people as I can.</description>
