# Update 1 - Hugo and Where I'm At

## Why Hugo?

I think that over time my web developer journey has become more about doing and figuring out what I want to do. I know that building Full-Stack Applications is an end goal, but in the meanwhile, I want to be able to produce value otherwise. I know that the community, and most people, could use someone who is keeping a pulse on the internet for them. They don't need a full-stack application to sell their goods, themselves, or build a community. 

The simplicity, robustness, and community of Hugo is something that helps motivate me. I feel as if I've been stagnant in terms of my learning, not really learning anything new but not applying what I know. This templated site is the start, I want to make my own templates. One's that are so robust and useful that I will start having a basic grasp of GoLang and a complex grasp of CSS and HTML. I want to continue to respect privacy by reducing Javascript reliance. People visit sites to get some type of info, not to be tracked.

I can't be an expert overnight, but taking my time and learning is what I need to do. I always find myself making excuses not to go through because I don't have an end project in mind. I think that is part of my struggle trying to run my web development business, a chicken and egg issue. Do I learn a new skill that I have nothing to apply to, or do I get work that forces me to adapt and learn a new skill? Spelling it out makes it sound simple, just build, build, build; and that sounds like the right thing to do. On top of that, my level of interest just rises and sinks so often.

For those interested keep your head up for a Hugo theme made by yours truly. I might migrate this blog over to that when I'm done, but I am so interested in making business-facing sites so the theme I create will probably be more for work. Regardless, let's say my goal is to improve at Hugo right now and build a collection of sites that I can manage.
