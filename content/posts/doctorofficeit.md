This is a project I had in the works for a period of over 4/5 months. My goal was to replicate the site, which I did, and then touch up that recreation to bring it modern features. I also wanted to give the home page a bit of a facelift, and fix other various minor errors. I am happy with how it came out! The experience taught me about hosting, BootStrap 5, and semantic HTML.

Recreation of Original
----------------------

I had access to the code for the original site but decided to see if I could mimic the site, seeing it was made using a version of Bootstrap 3. This didn't pose too many difficulties other than understanding when I needed to enable some of the JavaScript functions in Bootstrap 5.

Home Page of remade site.

Semantic HTML
-------------

One part of the project that changed as I took the original code and made it into the new site, was adding links to proper locations. This was important in the footer as well as the header of the page. I needed to make it so that users can click and get access to their email or phone service of choice. While this seems like a small change, keeping these up to date puts more credibility on the client's name.

Touch-up
--------

While recreating the site, I had to translate some of the ideas and tools used in Bootstrap 3. While the old page included a lot of space left over, I want to eliminate that as well as keep the original formatting. To do this I used some viewport measurements.

I liked how the remake came out! I think that even simply using a more recent version of Bootstrap for styling and hosting it on a new service gave the speed of the site a great boost! One thing I try to boast about the sites I create is my google lighthouse analytics. While not the end all be all of a site, it can be a good way to grasp how well static sites are built.
