I can comprehend what small businesses owner go through by the experiences I've had working with them. I have seen both sides of the coin in terms of what big and small business does. I know that often small business owners can be busy all the time, having unrelenting pressure to work because of the [absurdly high failure rate](https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/the-true-failure-rate-of-small-businesses/361350#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20from%20the,about%20half%20will%20have%20failed.). I originally thought it was 90% as mentioned at the start of the article, but 70%, not too bad...

Right now in the early stage, I have a checklist which I add and remove things weekly. I intend to use this first month as a basis for just refreshing myself on tools I want to use as well as getting back to working on some form of web development daily. I would in the past use this as a time to get my GitHub page green for the month but I understand more important tasks are at hand. Some of which are WordPress, hosting/domains, and Bootstrap. For the next couple of days, I want to establish my online presence by documenting the journey. This included linking and updating my social media, a bit of a task but something to take one program at a time.
