What Workflow?
--------------

One major shift in terms of the way I want to further pursue my ideal web development dreams has to do with my workflow. I think that while I was focusing on too many different things, I had nothing to a point of being extremely comfortable. I want to create, manage, and innovate a system for myself that allows me to best invest my time in web development. I hope you likewise find a system for yourself.

1\. Initial Contact
-------------------

The first thing we should be asking ourselves is what the client wants. Do they need a CMS, static content, emails, etc? This is then further added on by what type of budget they have, how long the project should take, and other requisites for what is needed.

This can be shortened into, 'what is the scope of this project'. With that can the goal be met, what are the goals, and how quickly?

2\. Sketch/Wireframe
--------------------

It helps to get a basic understanding of how the end user wants the design of the website to be laid out. While I don't think you have to make a specific layout, sticking to stuff within your ability is reasonable. I think reaching beyond can be beneficial as well, but trial by fire is just that, so don't burn yourself. You can also start thinking about what developer tools and programs will be used to create the site. Remember, the end-user doesn't care if they are using a site that has Vue, React, and Angular on it.

In my personal case, I think laying out the general formatting of the site, along with the site structure allows for the breaking up of content, which a graphic designer can work with. I also think having a basic understanding of the eco-system of the user's site is useful, for example understanding a bit about construction logistics for a construction website.

3\. Handoff
-----------

This is the part where a lot of outsourcing comes from. Dribble, Upwork, and all the other for-hire freelance services are your friend. Get to understand a bit about why you hire these people and in my case, take a step back. I make projects kind of personal, a mark of my own aptitude, ability, and confidence. But, the site will be better by getting people who specialize to create the site.

4\. Develop
-----------

Developing the site is your last stop. This is where you use previous work, and leverage skills you've learned to finalize and create the site. Documentation as well as using previous work is highly encouraged.

Check in with the clients as well during this stage to provide updates on the timeline. Most of the time you should be in contact but during handoff, it might be a few days of short relatively quiet updates.

5\. Maintain
------------

At this point the site is up a running, the domain is bought, and you are hosting them happily. Now to keep them up to date about uptime, visits, and other services that might help them establish and keep their online presence.

Make sure you keep them in the 21st century with ways to communicate with them on the site, up-to-date prices, and the correct date on the copyright footer :).
