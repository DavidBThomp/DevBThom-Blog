I have a few websites that are in my control and keeping them all up to date has become a bit of a task. I know that consolidation to a single site will come down the line but right now I have to live with the mess. I have this blog, a small [pers](https://davidbthomp.github.io/index.html)[o](https://davidbthomp.github.io/index.html)[nal/portfolio site](https://davidbthomp.github.io/index.html), and other mockup sites under my management. I am leaning more towards removing some of the ugly sites, such as my WEB 250 Final project but it displays an understanding of technologies that other sites don't...

Re-learning some of the tools used on the sites such as bootstrap is also a priority. I have a notepad list of things to get done over the next few months with a March launch time expected. I have become more patient and am not expecting an explosion launch, but a smooth transition of the work I did over the previous month into a workable profitable model.

Filling in a gap/Learning
-------------------------

While I want to be able to proudly proclaim I know it all, that simply won't ever happen. One thing I want to really get a grip on is Full-Stack Development. I can already see some of the gaps WordPress and basic hosted sites leave the developer, having that extra control will allow me to create applications that truly are world-class. I think this comes with many more tools I want to become better at, but right now sticking with my Udemy course and diligently working on a Full-Stack project of my own is of priority.
