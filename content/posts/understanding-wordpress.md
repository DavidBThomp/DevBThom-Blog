One thing I found confusing about WordPress was how themes, plugins, and widgets can change so much over the management of a site. For one theme you have an editor, for another one you have customization, and so on. I think one thing that was made clear to me from the Udemy course I took regarding WordPress is to find your way to make one thing, then add on. You don't have to learn how to use the new editor, themes, widgets, plugins, and all the other new features at once.

Making a Blog
-------------

WordPress serves as an excellent place to create and manage a blog. Once you learn the basic administration you can run and start trying different themes which has the greatest effect on how the site is managed. The default themes WordPress provides every year can be a great starting place to document some ideas. Jumping into other popular themes like Astra and Neve can be the next logical step. With such a large and supportive ecosystem behind either, you can solve problems pretty easily.

Then we can get into small themes that aren't necessarily managed by larger companies. These can be a bit more tricky and call for more understanding of the underlying code that makes them operate. This can even get into the territory of you jerry-rigging the theme so much it almost feels like your own. This can be tricky but often rewards you with sites that are less generic.

And other Social Media
----------------------

I think WordPress lends its self the category of social media. You link your other pages so that people can see what you are doing, who you are, and networking. The next logical step is learning social media management tools and establishing an online presence in other ways. Google ads, blog posts, etc. I think that when skimming the top of WordPress you can walk away with a nice blog page, but diving deeper will allow you to create and expand brands.
