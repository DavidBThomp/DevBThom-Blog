The vision for this project was to re-create the site staying committed to the basic sitemap of the current site. To do this, we simplified the sitemap even more and decided to work on a single page site. The only external tools used is jQuery and Google Fonts.

The 3 key points for the new site:

*   Theming and Site Color
*   Navigation and Footer Fixes
*   Responsive Web Design

Theme and Color
---------------

The old site used a color pallet of light green, red, and white. These colors and layout of the site led to an excessive amount of green white space, as well as abrupt color transitions. For this restaurant and layout, the color theme wasn't appropriate.

We choose to change to a more stable red color, with red accents and white text. This uniform color is more consistent and still allows for the parts of the site to stick out such as the logo and name. This color also works well with images of food plated on black. The simplicity of colors matches the simplicity of the site.

Navigation and Footer Fixes
---------------------------

The navigation could be simplified, as mentioned in the sitemap. This makes the UX (User Experience) more coherent and easy to navigate. The site had features which are now on the single page, instead of pointing users to a new page, the user can scroll and find the information they need.

Responsive Web Design
---------------------

Lastly, but most importantly, the web has shifted to being used on phones more often than desktops. This makes is critical that sites function on mobile web browsers. The failure to build responsive means that users on difference devices will be left behind. Losing customers over a lack of ability to use a site is a the basis for modern web design, and why the new site is responsive on multiple viewports.
