I think that a lot of the time, web development can be an end goal for someone, a means to a purpose. I am in that same boat but want to use it as a means to a degree of fulfillment. I view what I want to do as a path that has different options. A corporate job, passionate software developers, freelance nomads, etc. I see myself as someone pursuing that freelance nomad ideal with the addition of wanting to help as many people as I can.

While I have my end-game goals of running a successful web development consulting company, helping those from the city I'm from, and designing stunning websites using techniques people thought were out of reach, I know it will take baby steps. This blog serves are a reminder of what I did, why I thought certain things, and as a form of documentation of how it was done. In addition to what was outlined, there are other principles I would like to be guided by such as contributing to the FOSS community, being involved in the local development communities, and helping my friends and family establish themselves online that will contribute to their well-being.
