When looking to add to your toolkit as a web developer, WordPress is a great place to start and add to your tool kit. I earned my Associate in Applied Science in Web Development and wanted to work ASAP. As I started looking at what I could do on my own I realized my skills and potential would be limited if I didn't learn about the platform that hosts 33% of websites! While I took a class in WordPress, it simply didn't prepare me as well as this Udemy Course did.

Overview
--------

Andrew Williams does a great job of breaking down various aspects of WordPress in a quick concise manner. One part of Udemy I think makes it such a powerful tool is when the programs have clear and logical points to follow.

You can easily go through the course as a refresher for certain aspects as well as drop in on parts that you want to learn. The course is fairly short though, updating it with more modern WordPress features would be nice instead of loading in other Udemy courses.

Conclusion
----------

Andrew's Wordpress course can serve as a great baseline for learning WordPress. As with everything related to IT, you can always learn online for free, but for the conciseness, clarity, and value you can get from this course, I would highly recommend it. As for all courses on Udemy, wait until you can get them in a bundle or sale for the most value. Often, many of the other courses you can bundle with it act as a great follow-up!
